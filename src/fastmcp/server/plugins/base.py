"""Plugin primitive for FastMCP.

Plugins package server-side behavior — middleware, component transforms,
providers, and custom HTTP routes — into reusable, configurable,
distributable units. A plugin is a subclass of `Plugin` with a
class-level `PluginMeta` and an optional nested `Config` model.

        Reads `version`, `description`, `author`, and `homepage` from the
        distribution's metadata (as recorded in its `pyproject.toml` and
        exposed via `importlib.metadata`), and pins the distribution
        itself as the sole entry in `dependencies` — so the manifest

        with every new release. Runtime dependencies declared in the

        pass additional runtime deps via the `dependencies` override.
